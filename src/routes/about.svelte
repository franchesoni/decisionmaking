<h1>Rational-Subjective Decision Making</h1>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
    This app will help you make better choices!
    And "better" is defined by you.
</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>
This app brings some rationality into subjective decision making.
Decision making implies choosing the best option from a list of options.
Your first guess can be improved by looking at the options at different angles.
To make better choices, you should define some criteria, and evaluate your choices under these criteria.
Then you will be able to see what your criteria implies in terms of choices and viceversa.
